tc.research_name.SILVERPOTION=Silverwood Potions
tc.research_text.SILVERPOTION=Spot cleaning taint!
tc.research_page.SILVERPOTION.1=Ethereal blooms are wonderful, but if you plant them too far apart, you can miss spots, especially in the corners. This potion, made from silverwood leaves, will cure blighted land and creatures in a 5 block radius. It doesn't eradicate tainted blocks besides those it hits directly, but any remaining blocks will not survive long on cured land. Unlike a bloom, this potion does not offer continuous protection, meaning it's possible for the land to become reinfected, sometimes quite quickly. On the plus side, the potion will also vacuum up any flux created from the purification of tainted land.

tc.research_name.PURITYFOCUS=Purity Focus
tc.research_text.PURITYFOCUS=The Blight Buster
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.1=You have found a way to infuse the properties of an ethereal bloom into a wand focus. When you right click on a block, a 3x3 area and all blocks above and below it will immediately be cured of taint. Left click will clean only one column of blocks. Each column of tainted blocks that is purified costs %s.<BR>Crusted taint will leave behind large amounts of flux goo, so be wary of creating rapidly-growing thaumic slimes when working near it.
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.2=As well as cleaning blighted lands, you may heal creatures infected by the taint by right clicking them with a wand equipped with this focus. This will also cure them of the Taint Poison debuff. Healing creatures costs %s. This effect works at great distances.<BR>Additionally, you can remove taint from nodes by left clicking them (note that wands equipped with this focus are unable to destroy any blocks, so fear not for the node's safety). This requires a lot of vis, however, needing %s. Take care to ensure that the nodes you clean do not get infected again in the future.
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.basic_upgrades=    §nBasic Upgrades: Every Level§r<BR>§nFrugal§r: Reduce all focus ability vis costs by 10% per level like any other focus.<BR>§nEnlarge§r: Expand the dimensions of the Purity Focus's area of effect by 2 per level, up from the default 3x3 area. Allows for a 13x13 area to be cleaned with Enlarge V, but beware the potentially very high vis cost!
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.architect=        §nArchitect: Level 1§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/foci/architect.png:0:0:255:255:0.0625</IMG>Just like when applied to the Warding or Equal Trade Focus, this upgrade allows the caster to fine-tune the shape of the Purity Focus's area of effect. The area of effect is shown visually and may be changed using the misc wand toggle key (default G). Sneak + G allows toggling which dimensions to alter.<BR>This upgrade also expands the maximum area of effect by 2 blocks like a level of Enlarge.
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.vacuum=       §nFlux Vacuum: Level 3§r<IMG>blightbuster:textures/foci/fluxVacuum.png:0:0:255:255:0.0625</IMG>The days of manually cleaning up flux are over. A Purity Focus with this upgrade will suck up all flux goo and gas (including that which is created when cleaning crusted taint) as well as any thaumic slimes in its area of effect.<BR>This costs %s for each block of flux cleaned.
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.node=      §nNode Purifier: Level 5§r<IMG>blightbuster:textures/foci/nodePurifier.png:0:0:255:255:0.0625</IMG>All nodes cleansed by a Purity Focus with this upgrade will become pure nodes which are naturally immune to being reinfected. They will work to keep the taint at bay by transforming their surrounding biome into a Magical Forest.<BR>This upgrade also allows the Purity Focus to purify all nodes in its area of effect, rather than only ones that are directly targeted with left click.
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.curative=         §nCurative: Level 5§r<IMG>blightbuster:textures/foci/curative.png:0:0:255:255:0.0625</IMG>This upgrade augments the Purity Focus's therapeutic light. It will now heal all friendly creatures and players (except for the caster) in its area of effect or are targeted with right click by %s hearts of health.<BR>Just like curing creatures of taint infections, healing creatures costs %s for each one healed.<BR>A Purity Focus with this upgrade also makes its holder immune to the Taint Poison debuff while on a wand in the inventory. 
tc.research_page.PURITYFOCUS.blightBuster=      §nBlight Buster: Level 5§r<IMG>blightbuster:textures/foci/blightBuster.png:0:0:255:255:0.0625</IMG>This upgrade modifies the Purity Focus's cleansing power to deal massive damage to tainted creatures.<BR>Deals %s hearts of damage to any tainted creatures it finds in its area of effect or are targeted with right click at the cost of %s each.<BR>This shift in priority removes the ability to cure tainted animals and villagers; all blighted creatures shall feel your wrath.

tc.research_name.DAWNTOTEM=Totems of Dawn
tc.research_text.DAWNTOTEM=The start of a glorious new era!
tc.research_page.DAWNTOTEM.1=By infusing ethereal blooms into a silverwood log, you have created the totem of dawn. It is the greatest magical protection against taint you have yet devised. Boasting an area much larger than a bloom, this totem also excels in keeping the edges of its area free of taint. It may take slightly longer to completely clean an area, however.

tc.research_name.DAWNCHARGER=Dawn Charger
tc.research_text.DAWNCHARGER=Magical RF Transfer
tc.research_page.DAWNCHARGER.1=Combining Silverwood Logs with an energy cell frame and infusing it with magic creates a new device, functioning similar to a tesseract. When placed on top of any RF-transferring block, it will wirelessly transfer RF to any Dawn Machine your wand is bound to. Simply right click the Dawn Charger with your wand to bind it.

tc.research_name.DAWNOFFERING=Offering of Dawn
tc.research_text.DAWNOFFERING=Clean ALL the places.
tc.research_page.DAWNOFFERING.1=The Dawn Machine is an amazing piece of machinery, but it is hard to move. For this reason, you have invented the Dawn Offering, a piece of obsidian infused with teleportation magic that can call the Dawn Machine to its location. To use it, right click the center of your Dawn Machine with a wand. Then, place the dawn offering block in the world. Right-click the dawn offering with the same wand to teleport the Dawn Machine. For convenience, all connected jars and tubing in a 5x5 area centered on the Dawn Machine will teleport as well. The dawn offering is destroyed in the process; it cannot be reused.

tc.research_name.DAWNMACHINE=The Dawn Machine
tc.research_text.DAWNMACHINE=The end of Taint

tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.1=You have done it. You have created the most effective (and most needlessly complex) taint killing machine that will likely ever exist. It is a fusion of Homeworld's technical mastery and the recently discovered alien magitechnology. You will call it the Dawn Machine.<LINE>You begin by taking a dawn totem and augmenting it with gears, wires, and processors. Infusing it with essentia is a key part of this process. This grants you the core of the Dawn Machine: The cyber totem.
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.2=To create the Dawn Machine, take the cyber totem and place it between two silverwood logs, each three blocks high, as shown in the following picture. Right click the totem with a wand charged with at least 20 ordo vis to finish the construction. <IMG>blightbuster:research/dmresearch1.png:0:0:256:256:.5</IMG>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.3=At its most basic, the Dawn Machine functions like a totem of dawn with a longer range and is much faster, cleaning a 16x16 block area at a time. It also acts as a chunkloader, which is good for the cleanup process. However, the machine can be upgraded by providing it with essentia. There are ten different ports on the Dawn Machine. Each accepts a different type of essentia. Each type of essentia will upgrade the machine in a different way.<LINE>If given sano essentia, any tainted villagers, chickens, cows, pigs, sheep, ocelots, wolves and creepers in the area cleansed by the dawn totem will be healed of their infection.
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.4=If given aer essentia, the Dawn Machine's cleansing area will clean the entire continent, as opposed to a 144x144 block area (9x9 chunks) without. Keep in mind this means the chance of any given square being cleansed will be lower.<LINE>If given ignis essentia, the Dawn Machine will burn away tainted blocks as it cleans, purifying dirt, liquefying crusted taint, and eradicating fibers (as though a purity focus was used on the area). This ensures the area stays clean, and prevents immediate re-infection.<LINE>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.5=If also given vacuos essentia, (in addition to ignis) then the goo created by destroyed crusted taint will be vacuumed up. Because flux goo can also create taint, this can also help prevent an area from becoming reinfected.<LINE>If also given arbor essentia (in addition to vacuos and ignis) then a sapling will be planted anywhere there used to be a tree. (The Dawn Machine can tell where a tree used to be by detecting crusted taint blocks stacked on top of each other.)<LINE>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.6=If given auram essentia, tainted aura nodes in the cleansed area will be cured of their taint, becoming normal nodes. (This is expensive! 4 auram essentia will be required per node cleared.)<LINE>If given herba essentia, grass will be immediately replanted anywhere dirt is exposed to direct sunlight.<LINE>If given ordo essentia, the Dawn Machine will cleanse in an outwards spiral instead of random squares. This makes it less likely that you will 'miss a spot', which will speed cleaning.<LINE>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.7=If given cognitio essentia, the Dawn Machine will be smart enough to skip over any previously cured land; if the spot it attempts to clean is already clean, it will immediately pick a new spot to clean instead.<LINE>If given machina essentia, the Dawn Machine will work three times as quickly, activating five times per second!<LINE>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.8=The amount of essentia this machine consumes is astounding. There is a way to lessen it, however. Providing RF to the Dawn Machine, through the plug directly under the cyber totem, halves the amount of essentia this machine requires. Likewise, you can place a spark on the Dawn Machine to provide it with mana, which has the same effect. There may also be another way using more...sinister kinds of magic to make the conversion even more efficient.<LINE>
tc.research_page.DAWNMACHINE.9=The Dawn Machine, fully supplied with essentia, will clean the entire continent quickly and efficiently. However, it may prove difficult to keep up with its essentia demands. Now that you have the research to do so, your final task will be to come up with ways to provide the needed essentia...<LINE>To keep it from consuming essentia when not in use, a redstone current may be applied to the center block to deactivate it.
